EECS325-Project2
================

A hops/RTT measuring script for Case Western Reserve University's EECS 325 Networks class. Note these are my pesonal answers to homeworks, and I assume no responsibility for plagarized work. This is here merely for the version control, and I'm too broke to pay for private repos. Use at your own risk.
